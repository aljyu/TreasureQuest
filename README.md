# TreasureQuest

The goal of this program is to find the hidden treasure.

The languages used are JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.

The web page will display a treasure map, in which a random pixel location represents where the hidden treasure is buried. Every time the player clicks on the map, the web page will tell them whether or not they are close to the location.

Once the player clicks on or near the location of the hidden treasure, the game will congratulate the player and tell them how many clicks it took to find the location.


(2/12/17) As of today, the game is complete without any fancy graphics.
